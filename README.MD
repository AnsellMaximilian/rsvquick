## About

### Description

A web application for quickly creating and sending customizable online RSVP invitations with attachable surveys/questions to ask potential attendees.
This application provides simple customizable options so that your RSVP cards can be created quickly while also still be infinitely unique. After creation, cards can be sent out by either sending your potential guests the link to the invitation cards or by using the automatically provided barcode which you can copy as images.

With RSVQuick, you can also ask any arbitrary questions with arbitrary options (answers) to gauge extra information about your attendees. For example, in a wedding, you may want to ask how many of your guests will be vegetarian and prepare the wedding meal menu accordingly. You can attach that exact survey in your RSVP card and assess the results after your guests have responded and determine how much vegetarian food you should order.
